- I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst
](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/electrical-and-computer-engineering).

- I am currently a member of [Network Science lab](https://websites.umass.edu/blorenzo/research/) and working as a research assistant in projects funded by NSF (CNS_2008309 and CNS_2225427), ARL FREEDOM (Covert communication and advanced sensing in contested electromagnetic environments), and Juniper Networks Collaboration (Investigating next-generation resilient wireless networks leveraging AI/ML for proactive anomaly detection and self-healing systems).


- My research interests include 6G networks, machine learning for wireless, fog/edge/cloud computing, quantum computing, quantum communication, device-to-device communication, the Internet of Things, dynamic network slicing, integrated sensing and communication, satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks, and covert communication.

- I serve on the Technical Program Committee of the [ACM S¬≥ Workshop 2025](https://s3.witechlab.com/#), co-located with ACM MobiCom 2025. I am a member of the [EURASIP Academy](https://academy.eurasip.org/academy-members) from 2024 to present.
